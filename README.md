# Invoice-to-PPA
Goal: automate the PPA creation process

achievements: can create a very simple gui with a drag and drop feature that can accept multiple files or folders at once, can take in a pdf and read it as text but loses formatting, can create a copy of empty ppa and edit values in it
Roadblocks: can't consistently get invoice data from pdfs due to varying formats
